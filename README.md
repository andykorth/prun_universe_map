# Taiyi's Prosperous Universe Map
An interactive, data-rich visualization of the Prosperous Universe game world. 
This project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring star systems, planets, and their resources, 
with features including:

Interactive SVG-based map of the game universe
Detailed information panels for each star system and planet
Pathfinding functionality to plot routes between systems
Visual indicators for planet tiers and available facilities
Integration with game data for up-to-date information on resources and COGC programs
React-based UI with D3.js for smooth interactions and animations

Perfect for players looking to plan their interstellar trade routes or for those curious about the vast 
Prosperous Universe game world. Contributions welcome!

### Tech Stack:

* React
* D3.js
* SVG
* Tailwind CSS

### Updating the PRUN data:

* Replace `public/prun_universe_data.json` with the contents from the FIO endpoint: https://rest.fnar.net/systemstars
* Replace `public/planet_data.json` with the contents of: https://rest.fnar.net/planet/allplanets/full
* Run the python script 

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
